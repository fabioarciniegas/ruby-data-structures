Data structures in Ruby.

Implemented so far:
 - AVL Tree
 - BinaryHeap
 - PriorityQueue


== Note
After a long time in the "real world" it is easy to forget the simple pleasure that got most of us computer scientists hooked into software in the first place: the fun of watching algorithms work and the thrill of watching the right numbers pop up on the screen. This project's main goal is having fun coding relatively abstract things like AVL trees from scratch and watching them work. Of course, if anyone is in need of one of these datastructures implemented in ruby, they are welcome to them too.
