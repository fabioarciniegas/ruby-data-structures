Data structures in Ruby.

Implemented so far:
 - AVL Tree
 - BinaryHeap
 - Traditional Array-implemented Heap
 - PriorityQueue (based on heap)
 

= Personal note

After a long time in the real world it is easy to forget the simple fun that got us computer scientists hooked into software in the first place: watching algorithms work, popping the right numbers on the screen. This project's main goal is to have fun coding classic data structures like AVL trees, from scratch. Of course, if you are in need of any one of these datastructures implemented natively in ruby, you are welcome to use them as well.
