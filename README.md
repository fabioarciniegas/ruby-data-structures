Data structures in Ruby.

Implemented so far:
 - AVL Tree
 - BinaryHeap
 - PriorityQueue


== Note

After a long time in the "real world" it is easy to forget the simple fun that got us computer scientists hooked into software in the first place: watching algorithms work, the thrill of watching the right numbers pop up on the screen. This project's main goal is to have fun coding classic data structures from school days, like AVL trees, from scratch. Of course, if anyone is in need of one of these datastructures implemented in ruby, they are welcome to them too.
