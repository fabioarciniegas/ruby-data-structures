Data structures and algorithms implemented in Ruby for fun (yet correctly).

 - AVL Tree
 - BinaryHeap
 - Traditional Array-implemented Heap
 - PriorityQueue (based on heap)

 - Quicksort
 

After enough time in "the real world" where so much of the focus is on integration/business/non-functionals it is easy to forget the simple elegance that got us computer scientists hooked into software in the first place: watching algorithms work. This project's goal is to have fun coding data structures such as Red-Black trees and algorithms such as Quicksort, from scratch.

If you are in need of any one of these structures in ruby, you are welcome to use them (except of course if you need them for school, in which case I strongly recommend you watch a good video online and implement it yourself. Professor Tim Rothgarden's Stanford courses on algorithms, available from Coursera are particularly good and recommended).
